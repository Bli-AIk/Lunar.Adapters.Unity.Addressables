### üßê Why is this refactoring necessary?
Describe the reason for this refactoring, such as:
- Improving code readability, maintainability, or performance of the C# adapter/bridge library.
- Reducing technical debt or complexity.
- Adhering to new design principles or best practices for the library.
- Addressing a recurring issue or pattern identified from bug reports.

---

### üí° Proposed Refactoring
Explain in detail the proposed changes to the C# adapter/bridge library, including:
- A high-level overview of the proposed refactoring.
- Specific classes, methods, or components to be refactored (e.g., `MyLibrary.Core.Bridge`, `Foo.Bar()`).
- The expected outcome or benefit (e.g., better performance, easier to test, improved API design).
- Engine-specific context: Editor mode / Play mode / Target platform / Scripting backend.

---

### ‚öñ Alternatives Considered
List any other approaches or refactoring strategies you considered and explain why the proposed one is the best fit for the C# adapter/bridge library.

Example:
- Tried a different memory management approach, but it introduced more overhead.
- Existing single-threaded implementation does not scale well in multi-threaded environments.

---

### üìù Additional Information
Provide any extra context, design sketches, or code snippets that would help explain the refactoring idea. This could include before-and-after examples or diagrams specific to the C# adapter/bridge library.
- Include example usage, pseudocode, or small scripts.
- Attach screenshots or diagrams if the refactoring involves editor integration or specific game engine scenarios.
